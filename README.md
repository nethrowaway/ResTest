### Introduction






### Usage

From the root directory run:

`composer install` to install dependencies.

and run `php ./bin/runner.php` to run the script




### Unit tests

I've written unit tests to cover the `./src` directory, which can be run using:

`./vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests/`
